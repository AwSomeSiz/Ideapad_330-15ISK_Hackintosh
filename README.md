# Lenovo Ideapad 300-15ISK Clover EFI for MacOS Monterey
This EFI I made for my friend's laptop in 2021.  
Then I did not have so much time to bring it to the ideal, so I will only be happy if you make any improvements to it.  
Unfortunately, this laptop is out of order, and I will no longer be able to update it myself.

Clover version - 5146

Configuration:  
• Processor - Intel® Core™ i3 6100U  
• Graphics - Intel® HD Graphics 520 + AMD Radeon R5 M430 (disabled)  
• Dispay resolution - 1366x768  
• Memory - 8 GB DDR4

What doesn't work:  
• WiFi (u need to buy [supported WiFi module](https://dortania.github.io/Wireless-Buyers-Guide/unsupported.html#supported-chipsets) or supported USB WiFi adapter  
• Touchpad (in my case the touchpad was from Synaptics and I didn't have much time to get it to work, but may be u ll do it)

Do not forget to update SMBIOS in config.plist and good luck with your usage, Bro!
